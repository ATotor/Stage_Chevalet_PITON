# Stage_Chevalet_PITON


This github is dedicated to Victor Piton's 2024 research internship at the Jean Le Rond d'Alembert Institute, in the [LAM team](https://www.lam.jussieu.fr/), at Sorbonne University. The internship is supervised by Jean-Loïc Le Carrou from the LAM, Kerem Ege and Quentin Leclère from the [Laboratoire Vibrations Acoustique (LVA)](https://lva.insa-lyon.fr/fr), at INSA de Lyon. It serves as a platform for the exploration into the intricacies of guitar bridge acoustics. The internship delves into the study of guitar bridges and their profound impact on acoustic properties. With a keen focus on utilizing the Udwadia-Kalaba formalism, the project aims to characterize these bridges in depth.
